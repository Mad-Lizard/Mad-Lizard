- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mad-Lizard
- 👀 I’m interested in rock climbing, reading, translating.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding (basics of JS, Node.js so on).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my first real-world coding experience.

My very first program was written on BASIC, it ran on a DIY computer made by my dad from TV, magnitola and a set of details. It was fun! Then I wrote some macroses in uni, and now I'm looking my way in the world of coding.
